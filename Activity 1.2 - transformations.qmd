title: "Activity 2 - transforming the big dipper"

You're looking at the sky and notice ursa major (aka: the big dipper). Let `Dipper` represent the matrix of 7 rows of 2 dimensional vectors shown in this plot:

```{r}
#| fig.width: 4
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
Dipper <- data.frame(X1 = c(-2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
                           X2 = c(1, -1, -1, 1, 2, 3, 3)) 

base <- ggplot() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-10,10,by=1),limits=c(-10,10)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-10,10,by=1),limits=c(-10,10)) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0)) +  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) +  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + 
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x='', y='')

base + geom_point(data = Dipper, aes(x = X1, y = X2), pch = 8, size = 3)

```

For 1 and 2, you are only allowed to find transformation matrices by reasoning about how the coordinates have changed (no matrix multiplication in `R` required.)

# 1.

You hop in a space craft and travel half the distance to ursa major. Now it looks like this:

What matrix `A` is such that `Dipper x A` produces the vectors shown above? You should be able to answer this by reasoning about how the coordinates have changed (no matrix multiplication in `R` required.)

Express `A` in math mode:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} ? & ?? \\ 
                      ??? & ????
                      \end{pmatrix}$$

Then create `A`, the transformation `Dipper x A`, and plot the transformation `Dipper x A` to verify your guess.

# 2.

Your friend in the space craft, who has their back turned to you, looks up and sees this:

What matrix $B$ is such that `Dipper x B` produce the vectors above? You should be able to answer this by reasoning about how the coordinates have changed with respect to 1, and using the commuting property of transformations.

Express `B` in math mode:

$$B = \begin{pmatrix} ? & ?? \\ 
                      ??? & ????
                      \end{pmatrix}$$

Then create `B`, the transformation `Dipper x B`, and plot the transformation `Dipper x B` to verify your guess.

# 3.

A black hole has warped and twisted the dipper!

What black hole transformer matrix did this??  (You should probably use `R` to figure this one out!)
