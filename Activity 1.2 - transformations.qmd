# Question 1

Consider the 3-dimensional vector $v = (2,-1,3)$.  Which of the vectors below are orthogonal to $v$?  Justify your response.

$$a = (1,2,0)$$
$$b = (1,1,1)$$
$$c = (3,0,2)$$
$$d = (3,0,2)$$

# Question 2

## A. 

Consider the four transformation matrices below.  Which of these yield $2 \rightarrow 2$ transformations, and which yield $2\rightarrow 1$ transformations?  Justify your response.

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 \\ 1 & 2\end{pmatrix}$$
$$B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$
$$C = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 2\\ 3 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$
$$D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 5\end{pmatrix}$$

## B. 

Below is code for simulating a data matrix $X$ of 2-dimensional data and producing a scatterplot of the simulated data:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-asp: 1
#| fig-align: center

library(tidyverse)
n <- 40
set.seed(8049)

(X <- matrix(runif(n*2, -4,4), nrow = n, ncol = 2)
  %>% data.frame
) %>% head

# Set up ggplot template: 
(plot_template <- ggplot() 
  + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-10,10,by=1),limits=c(-10,10)) 
  + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-10,10,by=1),limits=c(-10,10))  
  + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0)) +  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) 
  + theme_minimal(base_size = 14)  
  + theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) 
  + labs(x='X1', y='X2')
)

# Add points: 
(Xplot <- plot_template 
  + geom_point(aes(x = X1, y = X2), data = X)
  + ggtitle('Plot of X')
)
```

Transform $X$ using the matrices from A) and create four scatterplots of the resulting linear transformations. Replace the four plots below with plots of the linear transformations.  Make sure to change titles of each plot to indicate which transformation matrix produced the plot.  

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-width: 8

library(patchwork)
(Xplot | Xplot)/(Xplot | Xplot)
```



# Question 3

You're looking at the sky and notice ursa major (aka: the big dipper). Let `Dipper` represent the matrix of 7 rows of 2 dimensional vectors shown in this plot:

```{r}
#| fig.width: 4
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.align: center
#| message: false
#| warning: false

Dipper <- data.frame(X1 = c(-2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
                           X2 = c(1, -1, -1, 1, 2, 3, 3)) 

plot_template + 
  geom_point(data = Dipper, aes(x = X1, y = X2), pch = 8, size = 3)

```



## A.

You hop in a space craft and travel half the distance to ursa major. Now it looks like this:

What matrix `A` is such that `Dipper x A` produces the vectors shown above? You should be able to answer this by reasoning about how the coordinates have changed (no matrix multiplication in `R` required.)

Express `A` in math mode:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} ? & ?? \\ 
                      ??? & ????
                      \end{pmatrix}$$

Then create `A`, the transformation `Dipper x A`, and plot the transformation `Dipper x A` to verify your guess.

## B.

Your friend in the space craft, who has their back turned to you, looks up and sees this:

![](images/clipboard-1822713031.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

What matrix $B$ is such that `Dipper x B` produce the vectors above? You should be able to answer this by reasoning about how the coordinates have changed with respect to 1, and using the commuting property of transformations.

Express `B` in math mode:

$$B = \begin{pmatrix} ? & ?? \\ 
                      ??? & ????
                      \end{pmatrix}$$

Then create `B`, the transformation `Dipper x B`, and plot the transformation `Dipper x B` to verify your guess.

## C.

A black hole has warped and twisted the dipper!

![](images/clipboard-2842492018.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Find black hole transformation matrix $C$ such that `Dipper %*% C` produces the image above.  (You can use `R` entirely to determine $C$ here.)
